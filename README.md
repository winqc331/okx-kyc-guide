## Creating Your OKX Account on Desktop

Head over to the official OKX website and look for the registration button. You'll see two options staring back at you: phone number or email. Pick whichever feels more convenient.

**If you're going with phone registration:**
- Select your country code (+84 for Vietnam, for example)
- Type in the last 9 digits of your number
- Skip that leading zeroâ€”the country code already covers it

**Choosing email instead?**
- Just enter your primary Gmail address

Now for the password. This one's important. OKX wants something secure: 8-32 characters mixing lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and at least one special character like @, *, #, or %.

There's an optional referral code field. You can leave it blank, or if you'd like, use code **47044926** to get started with some bonus perks.

Hit that Sign Up button and you're almost there.

**Quick tip:** Not feeling the traditional signup? OKX lets you register instantly through your Telegram account or Google Gmail. The buttons are right below the main form.      

Check your inbox for the verification code. OKX just sent one to whatever email you registered with. Copy that code and paste it into the verification box.

The beauty of mobile registration? You can complete everything while waiting for your coffee. The app handles verification codes automatically in some cases, making the whole process even smoother.

## Completing KYC Verification on OKX

After registration comes identity verificationâ€”KYC, as it's called in the crypto world. This step ensures your account stays secure and unlocks higher withdrawal limits. OKX walks you through it with clear instructions, usually requiring a government-issued ID and a quick selfie for verification.

The platform guides you through each step, and most verifications complete within minutes. You'll need your ID handy (passport, driver's license, or national ID card), decent lighting for the selfie portion, and a stable internet connection. That's really all there is to it.
